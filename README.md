## Features

## Requirements

This extension requires AWS Vault to be installed on your system. If AWS Vault is not installed, the extension will:
1. Show an error message
2. Provide a link to the official installation guide

### Installing AWS Vault

Visit the official AWS Vault repository for installation instructions:
[https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/tree/master](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/tree/master)

## How to Use

1. **View Current Profile**: Look at the status bar (bottom of VS Code) for the AWS Vault icon and current profile
2. **Select Profile**: Click on the "AWS Vault" status bar item to open the profile selection menu
3. **Refresh Profiles**: Click the refresh icon (üîÑ) next to the AWS Vault item to refresh the profile list
4. **Launch Terminal**: Use Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) ‚Üí "AWS Vault: Launch Terminal with Profile" to open a terminal with AWS credentials
5. **Clear Selection**: Choose "Clear Selection" from the profile menu to remove the current selection

When a profile is selected, the status bar will show: `‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Vault: your-profile-name`

### Terminal Integration
- If you have a profile selected, the terminal will launch with that profile
- If no profile is selected, you'll be prompted to choose one before launching
- The terminal runs `aws-vault exec <profile> -- $SHELL` to provide AWS credentials in the environment

### Debug Integration  
- When you run any debug configuration (F5 or "Run and Debug"), the extension automatically injects AWS credentials from the selected profile
- Uses `aws-vault exec` to get temporary credentials and adds them to the debug session environment
- Works with all debug types (Node.js, Python, etc.) that respect environment variables
- Only applies when an AWS Vault profile is selected
- Shows a notification indicating which profile is being used for the debug session

- `AWS Vault: Select Profile` - Opens the profile selection menu
- `AWS Vault: Refresh Profiles` - Refreshes and opens the profile selection menu
